For documentation on the afp system, consult
the manpages found in /doc

While the core of AFP is mostly complete, many of the
provided filters are in various stages of development.
Many filters which produce realtime audio work, but 
with poor audio quality.

Basic command invocation is:

./afp source ! {link !} sink

For example, to simply pipe a file to the speakers:

./afp libavsource -i "file.mp3" ! pasink

To do the same, but with a 100ms delayed echo mixed in:

./afp libavsource -i "file.mp3" ! delay -t 100 ! pasink
